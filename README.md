# Pixela Habit Tracker

Pixela Habit Tracker is a Python script that allows you to track your daily cycling distance and visualize your progress on a customized graph using the Pixela API. I have chosen cycling as my habit to track, but you can use it for any other habit you want to monitor by customizing the graph configuration. Simply replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME_HERE`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, and `YOUR_GRAPH_ID` with your actual Pixela account information, and you're ready to go!


It is a versatile and effective tool to monitor and visualize your daily habits, promoting personal growth and positive behavior change.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages using `pip install requests`.
2. Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME_HERE`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, and `YOUR_GRAPH_ID` with your actual Pixela account information.
3. Customize the graph configuration in the `graph_config` dictionary, such as the graph name, unit, type, and color.

## How to Use

1. When you run the script for the first time, you will be prompted to create your Pixela account by providing your username and agreeing to the terms of service.
2. After setting up your Pixela account, the script will allow you to input your daily cycling distance in kilometers.
3. The data will be stored on your Pixela account, and you can visualize your progress on the customized "Cycling Graph" through the Pixela website.
